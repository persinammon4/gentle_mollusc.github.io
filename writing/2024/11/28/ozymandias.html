		<h4>Ozymandias, or Pandora's Box?</h4>
<p> 28 Nov 2024 - persinammon4</p>

<div class="readability dragme">
  <h1>Ozymandias, or Pandora's Box?</h1>

    <p>This is the poem/sonnet <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46565/ozymandias">Ozymandias</a>.</p>
    <p>This is the story of <a href="https://www.greekboston.com/culture/mythology/pandoras-box/">Pandora's Box</a></p>

    <p>We are now in the Internet age, where gig work is becoming normalized,
    communication is very much online,
    and curiosity about other cultures is on the rise, among other effects.</p>

    <p>For all the positive effects, there are also negative effects- ghosting, cybercrime, etc.</p>

    <p>Therefore, I posit the reader- is the Internet <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46565/ozymandias">Ozymandias</a>,
	or <a href="https://www.greekboston.com/culture/mythology/pandoras-box/">Pandora's Box</a>?</p>

    <p>(P.S. I chose the story with hope at the end, because I'm guessing scientific progress is increasing
    at a faster rate thanks to the Internet, and that's why COVID was solved within two years.
    Don't look at my answer as truth though.)</p>
