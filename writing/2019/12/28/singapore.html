		<h4> Singapore </h4>
<p> 28 Dec 2019 - persinammon [mgnica redacted]</p>

<div class="readability dragme">
<p>It costs less than two dollars to cross over half of Singapore. Today I shuttled over from Commonwealth in heartland Singapore to Singapore University of Technology and Design in Upper Changi for 1.96SGD, so I should know. Singapore is small.</p>

<p>In Asia you will find the most aimlessly loose-shouldered, open-hearted people compressed into tiny boxes of tradition and resource constraint. Singapore is the epitome of it. Yet despite the constraints I feel very free here. I still gravitate to the gospel performing urban sketcher, the troubled 21 year old black and white artist, the colorful grandma giving a 100% into eccentric rainbow paintings, the MRT cashier who’s gonna go to KL with me, the laser-cutting kalimba and weapon making students, the international visitors staying the night. Singapore is large.</p>

<p>For the average person I give Singapore
3.8/5
in quality of life, but for me a 4.7/5. :)</p>

<p>Singapore is small in size but large of heart. Let’s enjoy life together!</p>

<p>As a side note, there is so much drama in my research group, I’m reeling.</p>
