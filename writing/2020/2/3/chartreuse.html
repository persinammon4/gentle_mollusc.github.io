    <p style="line-height: 2;">
      Yesterday my mom casually, almost gleefully told me a story of a car full of Japanese people
      trapped by tsunami waters. Rather than panicking and screaming, they quietly awaited death
      and drowned. It was her example of how repressed Japanese people can be. I imagined six of them,
      some hands clenched and some hands floating, waiting. I swore repeatedly and told her not to invoke
      tragedies like that in casual conversation.
    </p>
    <p style="line-height: 2;">
      Today I needed a full bladder for an ultrasound, so I drank water until I puked. I penned this
      poem in the waiting room to feel better.
    </p>
    <p style="line-height: 2;">
      The rest you should infer.
