		<h4>PALETTE PROMPT</h4>

<h1>Palette Prompt</h1>
<p>Hello, world!</p>
<p>Let’s take a short interlude from the regularly scheduled content
  to talk about one of my favorite things — colors!</p>

<p>Notice how there are squares with colors in them off to the side of the white
 drawing canvas? Those are palettes, or color schemes. In art it is impossible to
 have every single possible color represented at once, so artists pick a subsection
 that they can mix and use to create more colors. In this case, when a visitor clicks
 a color, a description of the overall palette and of the color appears.</p>
<p class="heading">Task</p>
<p>To pick out a color palette representing your hometown.</p>
<p class="heading">What’s In It For You</p>
<p>What’s in it for you? Visitors to my site will learn more about your hometown
  by clicking on the colors, and your internet handle will be credited in the HTML code.</p>
<p class="heading">What Was In It For Me</p>
<p>What was the motivation behind this? For this art project I first wanted to cherish
  my childhood and hometown. I used to dislike my hometown, but by doing palette prompt
  I grew to appreciate the place and time more. I also wanted to connect color to words
  in a meaningful way and practice JavaScript.</p>
<p class="heading">Instructions</p>
<p>Search “color picker” in Google.</p>
<p>Use the color picker to pick out as little or as many colors as want and record their hex codes.</p>
<p>Write a short or long description for each hex code.</p>
<p>Send me the hex codes, hex code descriptions, name of hometown, and favorite internet handle.</p>
<p>Palette prompt is very open-ended. For example, I chose 8 pastel colors with sights and fine
  details from my childhood in Sunnyvale. Someone else chose a bold minimalist 2 to represent the
  iconic San Francisco through the Golden Gate Bridge. Yet again someone else chose a balanced 5 for
  a symbolic yet proud view of the summer and activists of Taipei.
First and foremost do what feels right to you for palette prompt. It is your hometown and memories.
By doing this for a place you know like the back of your hand and have a strong emotional connection to,
 like hometown, you reflect and evoke emotional and visual memories.
Secondly, if anyone is having difficulty, consider going naturalistic and possibly using color chooser
 on photos of hometown for this prompt. I’d be interested in the results.
No choosing from flags allowed, palette has to represent the real place to you.
No cheating — it must be your hometown. Sorry towards people who moved around a lot.</p>
